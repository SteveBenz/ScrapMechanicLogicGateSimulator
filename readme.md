# Scrap Mechanic Logic Gate Simulator/Debugger

This is the source code for the tool for debugging logic gate circuits for scrap mechanic.
It might work well enough for other tick-based games that support logic gates as well.
The actual tool is hosted on [github pages](https://stevebenz.github.io/ScrapMechanicLogicGateSimulator/).

There are actually two code bases here, one in Python and one in TypeScript/React.
The Python one was written first, because I wanted to learn Python and that seemed
like a fun project to try it on.  Later on, I rewrote it in TypeScript/React -
again, out of a desire to learn that stack.  Both code bases are more than a bit
pants - I was learning as I was going and not really spending time to go back and
re-do old stuff with better technique.

There seems little point to the Python code, but if you feel otherwise, feel free
to take it over and do something useful with it.  I didn't delete it just because
there didn't seem to be any advantage to doing so.
