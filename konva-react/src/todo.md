# Debugging

Run 'code .' in the 'konva-react' folder.  Then run 'npm start' in a powershell window.  That will run the "Development Server"
and it'll stay running.  Recall that the 'start' verb is defined in ..\package.json.

# Todo List

## Make it friendlier

  [ ] It seems natural that clicking on an "Input" should toggle it.
  [ ] There should be a tutorial experience
  [ ] A context menu would help
  [ ] Inputs could remember their on/off state, pressing a "Reload" could cause them to play back
  [ ] A context menu could be used to make the timer configurable?

## Code Cleanup

- [ ] Rename App
- [ ] Convert to React Hooks
- [ ] Make it not do a full redraw on move
- [ ] Fix up how images are loaded

## Cut ideas

- [ ] All Input/Timer/LogicGate buttons can work on any interactable
