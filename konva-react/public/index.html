        <p>Drag logic gates, inputs, and timers from the button row at the bottom into the field.
          Wire them up by dragging from the source to the target.  Once you've got a circuit, click the
          Play button (green triangle) to set it in motion or the Single-Step button to watch it more
          carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can move gates around in the field by shift-dragging them.  Re-wiring is done much like
          it is in the game - re-connecting an already-connected pair deletes the link.  Wiring in the
          opposite direction reverses the link.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Gates, Inputs and Timers</em> - In the game there are buttons, switches and sensors that can
          feed into the game.  In the simulator, all the inputs are coalesced into the "Input" object --
          the single circle.  Toggle this on and off by selecting it and then clicking the "Input" button.
          Similarly you can change the type of logic gate by selecting it and clicking on the one you
          want to change to in the toolbar.  There is only one kind of timer - it's a "9 tick" timer in
          scrap mechanic parlance, but remember that in scrap mechanic, there's such a thing as a "0 tick"
          timer - which actually has the same delay as an 'and' gate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>State</em> - A white background indicates a "True" state for logic gates or "On" for inputs;
          a darker background indicates False/Off.  For timers, the white background means that the last
          stored tick of the delay is currently "True".  The connections change colors with state as well.
          Darker arrows come from sources that were on/true in the last tick.  The state-at-last-tick
          is the basis for how logic gates work:  At each tick of the clock, a new state is calculated
          for every element of the circuit based on the current state.  Once that is done for all elements,
          that new value becomes the new "current" state of the component.  The color of the arrows can
          show you which source caused your gate to be in the state it's currently in, even if the
          sources have changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Saved State</em> - It seems logical that if you exited and reloaded scrap mechanic, your
          creation would be as you left it.  But that's not how it is with switches and logic gates.
          They will return to the condition they were in when they were last changed in some way,
          where "changed" means either being taken off of a lift, a wiring change, a type change
          (for logic gates), or being painted.  The triangle in the upper-right corner indicates
          the saved state - if it's empty, that means its saved state is "false".
        </p>
        <p>Need more help?  Maybe some proof that the strange behaviors mentioned above are actually
          a thing?  Head over to the project home page.  The readme there has a much longer tutorial
          plus some experiments you can run yourself to get a grip on the odd save/load mechanics.
