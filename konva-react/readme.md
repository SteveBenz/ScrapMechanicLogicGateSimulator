# Installing and Debugging

> As usual, this was written well after I actually got everything installed
> and such, so I this is certainly incomplete.

Consult the [TODO List](src/todo.md) for known bugs and such.

## Stuff to install

* NPM
* Typescript

## Extensions

* ESLint
* TypeScript + Webpack Problem Matchers

## Getting Started

    cd konva-react
    npm install

Once you get that done, you need to run this in a dedicated console window or vscode terminal:

    npm start

Then, assuming all the right typescript stuff is installed, you should be able to
just F5 from VSCode to debug.
